Mother duck was sitting on her eggs and eagerly waiting for them to hatch. It felt like forever to her. "When are they ever going to hatch ?" she sighed. "I am getting bored being here all alone with no one to talk to." Even her husband, Drake did not come to visit very much.

Then, she felt something moved slightly under her body. She peeked under and saw her eggs starting to crack one by one. "Oh, my babies are hatching. I am so excited. I can't wait to see what they look like and take them out." she said. One by one the ducklings came out of their egg shell. They wobbled a little before they steadied themselves. There were five of them. Mother duck thought they looked so cute in yellow.
